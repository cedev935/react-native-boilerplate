# react-native-boilerplate
My first app using React Native

Let's start to create our standard template for React Native:

`npx react-native init ReactNativeBoilerplate`

After that I run Metro Bundler with this command:

`npm run start`


And in another terminal or tab you can run the app for ios/android:

`npm run ios`

or

`npm run android`


So for iOS everything worked on the first shot, but not for Android.
